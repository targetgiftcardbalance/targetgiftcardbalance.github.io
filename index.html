        <h2>What is Target Gift Card?</h2>
        <p>
            A Target gift card is a prepaid card that can be used to purchase items at Target stores or on Target's website. It functions like a debit card, allowing the cardholder to spend the amount of money loaded onto the card. These cards are available in physical and digital forms, and they can be purchased at Target stores, on Target's website, and at various third-party retailers. Target gift cards are popular for gifting because they offer flexibility, allowing recipients to choose their preferred items from a wide range of products, including groceries, clothing, electronics, and home goods​ (Target : Expect More.
